# ColorBusterGame
The game is written in .Net Framework 4.7.2 Windows Forms

# Introduction
The game consists of a panel that contains square tiles that need to be matched to other tiles of the same color directly above, below, to the right, or the left which means that no diagonal tile will give the user points. As the user matches a tile, a short “pop” animation will be shown on the screen and the user will earn 20 points per tile. This means that the more tiles that are consecutively matched, the more points the user will attain.
